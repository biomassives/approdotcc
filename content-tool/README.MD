Explanation:

Project root contains your source scripts (content_tool.py, content_ux.py), data (content.json), and the PyInstaller spec.

dist/ContentManager/ is the output of pyinstaller content_tool.spec:

ContentManager (the bundled executable)

Supporting files (your icon, the CLI script, and needed Python/Tk libraries)

dist/ContentManager.zip is the ZIP archive you create from the ContentManager directory. This ZIP is what you distribute to end users.


build/ is where PyInstaller stores intermediate files; you can safely ignore or delete it after packaging.

gui_wrapper.py can be a thin alias that invokes content_ux.py (you may merge or rename).

content_parts/ is an optional folder when you split the JSON into per-language files.

You can then:

Create a .desktop entry pointing to the unzipped executable or create a launcher that extracts and runs the app.

Share the ContentManager.zip with users on Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows, who can unzip and run the executable without needing Python installed.

This workflow ensures a smooth, one-click install and launch experience for your desktop GUI tool.
